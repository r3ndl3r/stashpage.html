# Stashpage
Stashpage is a clean, modern, and fully standalone startpage/dashboard for your homelab. Inspired by Heimdall, it allows you to organize all your self-hosted services and favorite websites into a beautiful and functional interface, all from a single HTML file.

All configuration is stored locally in your browser, requiring no backend or server-side processing.

## Features
* **Standalone & Portable**: Runs entirely from a single *.html file.
* **Local Storage**: All your apps and categories are saved in your browser's localStorage.
* **View & Edit Modes**: A simple toggle to switch between a clean dashboard and a powerful editing interface.
* **Drag & Drop**: Easily rearrange categories to your liking in edit mode.
* **Import/Export**: Back up your configuration to a JSON file or move it to another browser with ease via the settings menu.
* **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
